Got the gyaldem shake hips in the dance
Je m'appelle, man's Benz
Got gyal like ten from Paris, I can't come France
He wan' talk badness on my darg
Man a real cash man, I don't catch man's darg
Flip that, scribble that on the route, man's off
Grip that, fiddle that in the coupe, man's lost
Yo, grab the wheel, man's lost
Got the gyaldem shake hips in the dance
Je m'appelle, man's Benz
Got gyal like ten from Paris, I can't come France
He wan' talk badness on my darg
Man a real cash man, I don't catch man's darg
Flip that, scribble that on the route, man's off
Grip that, fiddle that in the coupe, man's lost
